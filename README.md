# Resources for server operators

This repository contains documentation and other resources useful to
server operators combatting spam.

For a general overview of what options are available in your chosen
server software, take a look at the [collection of anti-spam server
modules](collection-of-server-modules.md).

There is also some additional per-server documentation available,
currently only for Prosody, but feel free to submit a PR to cover
documentation and how-to guides for other software also!

## Prosody

- [Restricting account registrations from open proxies](prosody/restrict-proxy-registrations.md)
- [Using the JabberSPAM blocklist with Prosody](prosody/firewall-blacklist.md)
- [Creating custom anti-spam rules with mod_firewall](prosody/firewall-custom.md)
